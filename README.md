# ICND-1-Study-Guide

During the course of my studies for the ICDN 1 exam, these are the notes that I took. These notes are based around the CBT Nuggets videos as that is the training material I choose to use. All labs in these notes were completed using physical equipment, primarily Cisco 2901 Routers and 2960X Switches. You can use any variety of physical equipment as well as a virtual option like GNS3 and Packet Tracer.

I am by no means an expert, these are just what I created to make my way through the exam. Your milage may very depending on use case. Good luck with your studies!
